## ✨ Features

- **Sundered charms** are included in the grail tracker.
- **Persistent found items** (optional):  
  Toggle in **Settings → "Persist found on drop"** to count items you've found historically—no need to keep them on mules or in stash.
- **"Previously found" badge** + subtle grey checkmark beside items that are counted due to history (not currently in stash).
- **Clear persistent history** (with confirmation dialog):  
  Wipes the "Previously found" history and updates totals/badges instantly.  
  > ⚠️ **Warning:** This is **permanent**. Your stash is not touched.
- **Custom Sound notifications** for newly found items:
  - Customizable volume control
  - Support for custom sound files (WAV, MP3, OGG)
- **Theme & font tweaks** for a cleaner look.

## 🔊 Sound Notifications

Get audio alerts when you find new grail items!

> **Tip**: Use a distinctive sound that won't get lost in game audio. Short, clear notification sounds work best!
